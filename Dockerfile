# Docker file to build a container (with a bash shell) that has Python 3.9, curveball, and the dependency versions from 2021 required to run it
# The docker file should work to build the container on any OS - instructions for Ubuntu-based Linux distros are provided below

## Instructions
# To install docker from an ubuntu command line using apt: sudo apt install docker
# To build the container, navigate to the directory with this file and run: sudo docker build -t curveball_docker .
# To use (change path to the directory you want to have access to while working in the container): sudo docker run -v /path/to/work/directory/:/app/CurveBall -it curveball_docker   
# From there, the container will act like a normal linux terminal and curveball can be used as described in the documentation
# More details and instructions for installing docker, building from docker files, and using containers in other operating systems can be found at https://docs.docker.com/
